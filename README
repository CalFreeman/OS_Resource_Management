5-DESIGN DECISIONS & ISSUES
--------
Major Issues:
  -having issues passing incremented childprocesses (anything except 0, ie no 1-17),
    therefore It is only running deadlock avoidance on a single process
    which is not acquiring enough resources to initilize an avoidance of a possible deadlock.    --I was able to test my implementation of deadlock avoidace using max claims but unable to get it to work with the projects code.


Minor Issues:
-limited max forked processes to 100, this will and currently exceedes the 10000 line limit in the output file
-in addition I can't not seem to get the verbose flag to work on the childprocess, these has to do with the incremented childprocess counter
-i know i am still missing many intricate details, some aspects of my verbose mode are not working, and I am not counting for 10000 line termination
